Compose Decathlon Design System is based on Material Design compose artifact described
on the [official documentation](https://material.io/) and maintained by Google developers
and designers.

But these native components are overridden to respect Decathlon's Visual Identity. You'll find
the design specifications and technical information for supported platforms by Decathlon on
[decathlon.design](https://www.decathlon.design/). If you are interested by a sample,
you can install a demo with `sample` module in the technical project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

A `VitaminTheme` is available in foundation artifact from where you can get all
colors, typographies and shapes in your composable hierarchy. Note that this theme is
mandatory if you want to use any composable available in other vitamin compose artifacts.
If you don't use it, an error will be triggered at the runtime.

```kotlin
VitaminTheme {
  // Your composable declarations
}
```

## üì• Download

Release artifacts are available on Maven Central. Check the [release page](https://github.com/Decathlon/vitamin-compose/releases)
to know what is the latest release version of Vitamin artifacts.

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

implementation("com.decathlon.vitamin.compose:<component>:<last_version>")
```

If you want to test latest changes merge in `main` branch, you can test Vitamin Android from
snapshot artifacts but we don't recommend to use theses artifacts in production where you can
have regressions or breaking changes until the next official release.

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
    }
}

implementation("com.decathlon.vitamin.compose:<component>:<latest-major + 1>.0.0-SNAPSHOT")
```

If you have any question about the versioning of this project, you can just read our [documentation](https://github.com/Decathlon/vitamin-compose/tree/main/VERSIONING.md)
about it.
