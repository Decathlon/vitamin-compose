# Vitamin Compose (alpha)

> Decathlon Design System 🎨

Compose Decathlon Design System is based on Material Design compose artifact described
on the [official documentation](https://material.io/) and maintained by Google developers
and designers.

But these native components are overridden to respect Decathlon's Visual Identity. You'll find
the design specifications and technical information for supported platforms by Decathlon on
[decathlon.design](https://www.decathlon.design/). If you are interested by a sample,
you can install a demo with `sample` module in the technical project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

A `VitaminTheme` is available in foundation artifact from where you can get all
colors, typographies and shapes in your composable hierarchy. Note that this theme is
mandatory if you want to use any composable available in other vitamin compose artifacts.
If you don't use it, an error will be triggered at the runtime.

```kotlin
VitaminTheme {
  // Your composable declarations
}
```
